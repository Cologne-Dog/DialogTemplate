		"solventfree": "Solvent Free",
		"solventfree1": "Solvents such as alcohol damage tissues including the skin and lungs. {{userFirstName}}, have you ever felt a burning sensation breathing perfume or drinking alcohol? That's tissue damage",
		"solventfree2": "Turns out solvents also damage the cleansing and healing potentials of essential oils and other bioactive substances",
		"solventfree3": "Dogs can't stand solvents, they're just way too intelligent since they can literally smell the toxicity ‚ò£Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è üß™",
		"benefits": "Bioactivity",

		"ingredients": "View ingredients",
		"ingredients_deodorants": "Our deodorants are made with water, oils (vitamin D and E, avocado, carrot), essential oils (cedarwood, clary sage, jasmine, bergamot), 0.2% total weight food-safe Cologne.Dog Emulsifier Blend‚Ñ¢",
		"ingredients_biocosmeticals": "Our Biocosmeticals‚Ñ¢ are made with water, oils (vitamin D and E, avocado, carrot), essential oils (cedarwood, clary sage, jasmine, bergamot), Cologne.Dog Vegan Skin Stem Cell Serum‚Ñ¢ (l-acetate, matrix glycoproteins, riboflavin, pyridoxine, biotin, folate, cobalamine, retinoil acid, pantothenic acid), 0.2% total weight food-safe Cologne.Dog Emulsifier Blend‚Ñ¢",
		"benefits2": "Substances including essential oils have cleansing and healing potentials that are damaged by solvents",
		"benefits3": "By substituting solvents with our patent-pending lowest toxicity strategy, our products retain the cleansing, healing, and therapeutic potentials of essential oils and substances including vitamins",
		"toxicity1": "Dietary fats are chemically triglycerides. These chemicals are the baseline of safety, because they normally reside in mammalian development, anatomy, and physiology",
		"toxicity2": "Monoglycerides, diglycerides, and triglycerides are long chain carbon molecules with low or no amount of electron (electrical) imbalance. These properties make it safe",
		"toxicity3": "In contrast, solvents are short chain carbon molecules with high electric charge. In fact, ions, electrically bonded molecules, are more similar to solvents in toxicity than they are to fatty acids",
		"toxicity4": "At Cologne.Dog‚Ñ¢, we developed a novel formula for producing full oil and water emulsions by using the least amount of the lowest toxicity emulsifier blends who are most similar to dietary fatty acids",
		"science": "Our products were developed and formulated by a N.I.H. trained Ph.D. who specialized in the regeneration of collagen producing cells from the stem cells of adult mammals",
		"stemcells": "The mammalian ectoderm gives rise to the skin, while the mesoderm gives rise to internal organs and their lining, such as the oral cavity. These tissues are rich in blood supply, and adult stem cells reside there for tissue health and maintenance",
		"environment": "The manufacturing of solvents is the most polluting process in industry (http://tiny.cc/sm5dpz). Solvent exposure to humans and mammals is linked to systemic disease and cancer. In general, it's agreed that solvents are overused in industry, including the manufacturing of fragrances, cleansing, and health products",
		"logistics": "All our products are cruelty-free and contain no animal products. We take great measures to offer the most sustainable and responsible manufacturing to benefit you, your loved ones, and the environment",
		"guarantee": "First-time purchasers: love it or get your money back!"
